# Imitation Policy Minimal

Are you tired of constantly switching between multiple code files, original papers, and tutorials?
Frustrated by installing countless dependenciesâ€”only to run into conflictsâ€”when all you want is to run simple demos and learn from the code?

Imitation Policy Minimal is a minimal and educational implementation of imitation learning based policies for embodied AI.
This project integrates both Diffusion Policy and Flow Matching for simple control tasks like Pendulum-v1.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZidongChen25/Imitation_Policy_Minimal.git
cd Imitation_Policy_Minimal
```

### Create a Python environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
conda create -n diffusion_policy_minimal python=3.10
conda activate diffusion_policy_minimal
```

### Install required packages

```bash
pip install torch torchvision gymnasium tensorboard stable-baselines3 numpy
```
## How to Use

Imitation learning policy needs expert demonstrations, for example, human demonstration or we can train a RL policy such as PPO, SAC, DDPG. In this easy environment Pendulum, we use PPO to train an expert policy.

1. Generate expert demonstrations:

   ```bash
   python expert_policy.py
   ```

2. Create demonstrations:

   ```bash
   python generate_demonstration.py
   ```

   This will create an `expert_demo.npz` file containing expert trajectories.

3. (Optional) Check how the expert policy is doing:

   ```bash
   python policy_visualization.py
   ```
4. Train the policy:
    ```bash
    python diffusion_policy.py --mode train  
    # or
    python flow_matching.py --mode train
    ```
Training logs will be saved automatically and can be visualized via TensorBoard. This is an easy task with a lightweight model, and it can be trained within 5 minutes on an M4 MacBook Air.

5. Evaluate The policy will be evaluated in the Pendulum environment.

python diffusion_policy.py --mode inference
